Big goal is to rewrite this code to allow for Quest to be done once at the beginning and for there to be no cue and just the stimulus (bin the times for the inter-trial interval to allow for looking at this dimension....maybe do something like 1.5 - 4.5 s...so can do 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5)

1. Create main file for task
2. Create doTrial file for task
3. Create staircase functions
4. Create additional functions (figure out what these are)
